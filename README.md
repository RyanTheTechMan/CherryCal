## 🛠 Project Overview

**CherryCal** is built for users who want a **simple, intelligent**, and **streamlined** calendar experience.  
By leveraging powerful LLMs (Large Language Models), CherryCal:

- **Understands natural language** event descriptions.
- **Auto-tags** locations, participants, and relevant details.
- **Minimizes clicks** and complex menu interactions.

**Example:**  
Typing `Dinner at WGCC with Ryan` automatically:

- Sets location to **Washington Golf and Country Club**
- Adds **Ryan Ernest** as an attendee

✅ Currently integrates with **Google Calendar**, with future plans for **Apple Calendar** and **local calendars** support.
